The work is done, nfop supports now ttf fonts, see \tests\userconfig1.pdf :) 

All files in \build are prepared with ilmerge (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=22914587-b4ad-4eae-87cf-b14ae6a939b0), 
all you need is J# runtime.

Check out, compile, run \scripts\makeall.cmd, enjoy ;)
